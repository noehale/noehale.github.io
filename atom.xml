    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Taming and training your ferret could have never occurred to you as a possibility.</em> In reality, this approach is extremely beneficial and will save your ferret’s life. It would save you a lot of time and stress if you could teach him to come when called. However, as you are probably aware, ferrets are not the same as dogs.</p><p><img alt="How to tame and train your ferret" style="margin:0px 10px; max-height:212px; max-width:44% width:auto; height:auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/9xbpLnr.jpg" align="left">Ferrets, like dogs, learn by positive reinforcement. This implies that you must provide them with the necessary resources in order for them to learn and obey. Your job as a ferret owner is to provide positive feedback and to reward your ferret when he or she does something right. <em>Here are some suggestions for training your ferret while having fun.</em></p><p>Each time your ferret uses his <em><strong>litter box</strong></em>, reward him with a treat. A tasty treat, such as ferreting, can be put on the stick that will be used to train your ferret. The stick will be used to guide your ferret to the target location. Keep in mind that you must insert the stick into the grass, not just anywhere, so your ferret understands that when he comes into contact with the stick, he must use the litter box.</p><p>Always give your <strong>ferrets treats</strong> when they behave well. When your ferrets do something right, always reward them with treats. They might be doing something you’d like to see them do, like using the litter box. When your ferret does this correctly, he gets a treat.</p><p>Maintain consistency in your ferret’s <strong>potty training</strong>. Never let your ferret out of his cage to go for a walk outside. Keep the litter box clean at all times, and you can even take him outside on a leash to do his business, but you must still make sure your ferret knows where his litter box is.</p><p>Know that ferrets learn by <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>. If you want your ferret to learn to relieve himself inside the home, simply praise him whenever he eliminates outside. This will encourage him to do so more often. Start teaching him with simple commands like sit, stay, and come soon so he thinks he’s a pet rather than an animal.</p><p><em><strong>If your ferret makes a mistake, do not punish him</strong></em>. You can only correct him if he does harm to the space or anything else. This will teach him to be cautious in his decisions because he will not get a treat if he does. And you’ll find that your ferret will continue to repeat the process in order to win the reward. That is why you must be careful when training your ferrets.</p><p><em>So, how long must you be careful when it comes to ferret training</em>? You’ve already won half the fight if you can bear to look at him and hold him like that. If you force your ferret to go through training, he will be able to regulate his bladder in no time. However, you must begin training as soon as possible in order to and the amount of time it takes to train them. When you notice that your ferret is fairly self-assured, it is probably time to begin training your pet.</p><p>The first step is to <strong>establish a routine</strong>. For example, if you bring your ferret home, make sure he has a food and water bowl before you leave. You can be certain that he will have something to eat or drink if he becomes thirsty. The easiest way to show him how to catch and hold food or drink from your hands is to tape a treat to a target stick. Your ferret will learn what you want him to do if you use the goal stick every time he takes a treat from your side.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBB5HEuFRUo" allowfullscreen="true" style="margin:0px auto; display: block;" width="420" height="235" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Obedience training is another thing you should teach your ferrets. This entails you directing them in the right direction. Some argue that ferrets should not need training because they are naturally intelligent and curious animals. However, the same may be said of dogs. So, before you teach them yourself, it is best to seek professional assistance.</p><p><strong>The best trick to teach your ferret is possibly how to “press.”</strong> You might not be able to teach him this in a single session because ferrets are extremely sensitive to sound and pitch. You will help them become accustomed to this sound by giving them small treats and ensuring that they understand that sound equals treat. If they’ve gotten the hang of it, you can gradually raise the amount of treats and attempt to change the tone and speed of your speech.</p><p><em>Reference:</em></p><ul><li><a href="https://douglas.extension.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2020/12/Pocket-Pets-Small-Animals.pdf">https://douglas.extension.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2020/12/Pocket-Pets-Small-Animals.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://www-personal.k-state.edu/~sprite/FFSTART.HTML">http://www-personal.k-state.edu/~sprite/FFSTART.HTML</a></li><li><a href="http://cairo.lti.cs.cmu.edu/~hector/wikihow_xml/categorized/Pets%20and%20Animals/Small%20and%20Furry/Ferrets/Train-a-Ferret.html.xml">http://cairo.lti.cs.cmu.edu/~hector/wikihow_xml/categorized/Pets%20and%20Animals/Small%20and%20Furry/Ferrets/Train-a-Ferret.html.xml</a></li><li><a href="https://ferretvoice.com/ferret-training/">https://ferretvoice.com/ferret-training/</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Which ferret toys do ferrets like the most?</strong> That’s a good question,  because the right toys will help keep your new ferret happy. The best  ferret toys are interactive ones that encourage natural behavior like climbing, tunneling, and exploration. <em>Let’s look at some of the more popular ferret toys on the market today.</em></p><p>The Perfect Toy:  Ferrets Chew Tiles Plastic toys are very popular among ferret owners  because they’re durable, and they last longer than other, more common  plastic toys. The Perfect Toy by iRobot is a unique combination of two  completely different toys. First, it’s a soft and cuddly plush toy with a mouth-guard that your ferret can put his teeth into. Second, it’s a  plastic tunnel you can build for your ferret using his supplied tunnel  kit. This fun little toy comes with a plastic “bowl” and a bunch of  holes cut in the top so that your ferret can enjoy his “dungeon.”</p><p><em>Ferret Tubes and Tunnels</em> Make Great Ferret Toys Another great selection of  ferret toys is tubes and tunnels. Just because your ferret likes  sleeping in large open spaces doesn’t mean he won’t want to make his  personal nest. He does just that with tunnels made from plastic tubes.  Your furry pal can enjoy hours of sleep in one of these tunnels and then retreat to his favorite spot to snuggle up and relax. There are several different sizes of tunnels, so you can find one that’s just right for  your ferret. You can even get ones custom designed for your furry pal.</p><p>Recommended You Read:<a href="https://ferretvoice.com/best-ferret-toys/">https://ferretvoice.com/best-ferret-toys/</a></p><p><em>Soft &amp; Cute Rubber Toys</em> Small parts and soft, squishy toys are another  favorite of ferrets. Your little pet will have hours of fun playing with rubber toys that come in a variety of shapes, colors, sizes, materials, and materials. Like tunnels and tubes, these toys come in many  different types, including ones made of soft plush materials. These soft toys make excellent ferret toys because they’re not just safe but very  cuddly as well.</p><p>Ball Pit <strong>Ball pits</strong> are another selection of ferret toys that are perfect for keeping your playful pets occupied  during long car rides. The soft materials they are made to make them  safe to play with for a long time. Some come with lids so you can keep  them clean while others are made with mesh covers so they can be washed  with a mild detergent.</p><p><strong>Durable Plastic Toys</strong> These types of  ferret toys may take some extra effort to clean, but they are very  durable. Unlike other ferret toys, they do not lose their grip over time and need only a quick wipe down with a damp cloth. The material they’re made of is usually vinyl, which means it can be easily cleaned with a  sponge or a washcloth. They are also very easy to transport, which makes them ideal for home. If you are a first-time buyer, then plastic is  definitely the way to go.</p><p><strong>Chew Toys</strong>, also called ferret  treats, are the most popular choice of ferret toys among first-time owners. While they are not meant to be a substitute for food, chewing  toys are the best way for ferrets to exercise and keep their small  bodies in shape. A good chew toy should allow your ferret to stretch its little legs at least two times its length. Like all ferret treats, chew toys need to be made out of strong, durable materials, like stainless  steel, so they won’t rust or deteriorate over time. You might want to  consider a chew toy with a rubber squeaky sound feature for added fun.</p><p>Tunnel toys and Cat Toys Small balls and small cages made specifically for  cats can make great ferret toys as well. When cats tunnel, they use  unique tunnels that serve several functions. Not only do ferrets get to  exercise, play, or lie in wonderful tunnels, but cats can keep  themselves warm and safe from predators in the wild. Small balls and  tunnels are also a great option for pet ferrets who love to hang around  water, and even smaller cages work great as cat toys because they can be easily carried around and stored when not in use. Remember that if the  tunnel or ball is too large, your ferret could injure itself or become  stuck.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Ferret quiz and name game</strong> seem to be the latest trend in ferret names. With many children choosing cute names for their pets, the ferret name scene has also seen a surge in popularity. This article talks about the ferret quiz and name game and why it might not be the best idea.</p><p><em>Why is the Ferret quiz and name game so popular?</em> I have already described in some detail why not. In this article, we’ll look at the other side of the coin: Why should you name your ferret the way you do?</p><p>The first question to ask yourself when you ask, “What should I name my ferret?” quiz is, “Is it a pet I will be keeping?” When you take on the responsibility of owning a pet, then the chances are that you will want to spend some time looking for one. This means that you’ll need to find a name that is easy to remember and easy to spell.</p><p><strong>When we talk about naming our ferrets</strong>, what we really mean is that it is important to take time out of your busy day to make sure that your pet name reflects your personality and character. We all have different personalities, and if you find yourself drawn to an individual name, then it makes sense to give that name to your ferret. It doesn’t matter whether the name is cute or not - as long as it reflects your personality, then, by all means, name your ferret whatever you want!</p><p>However, if you plan to keep your pet in captivity, then you will want to consider the “proper” way to name your pet. As previously mentioned, the question “What should I name my ferret?” quiz is often asked by new owners. There are two types of ferret quiz and name game.</p><p>The traditional ferret quiz involves finding a ferret quiz that best suits your personality and determining what the ferret is called. In order to ensure that the answer you get to this question is indeed the right one, you should be willing to spend some time doing research and following instructions. Don’t be put off by this - it’s not difficult to go online and find the ferret quiz you need!</p><p>The other type of ferret quiz involves doing the name generation by hand. If you can spare some time and decide that you’re going to name your ferret according to your own personality, then this method is obviously much more difficult. This could involve sitting down with your friends or family and using their opinions and ideas to find the name that fits you the best.</p><p>Some people choose to name their ferrets according to their favorite books and movie characters. They may look into popular nicknames and end up choosing the name based on the character that they really like. If you choose to use this method, you should take care that the name you choose is neither offensive nor offensive to others.</p><p>So, what should you do when you have finally decided that you want to name your ferret, but have no idea what to call him? Perhaps you will be happy to accept the short answer: “I am not sure.”</p><p>Who should you get your ferret from? When you start to think about choosing your ferret, you need to think about whether you would prefer to buy one from a breeder or an animal shelter. For more information about this, please click here. In general, anyone who is local to you know a little about how to take care of your pet will probably be the right choice for you.</p><p>To help with this, ask the breeder if he or she will perform a full background check on the pet breeder. You should also be aware that if you choose a breeder from a shelter, he or she may not be a vet, and this could pose problems later on, as many vets prefer not to have pet animals that come from shelters.</p><p>When you do decide to get baby ferrets, you should also keep in mind that you should never buy from someone who is not a vet. Many people sell baby ferrets from shops, but these should not be trusted. Or trusted, and they don’t always have the knowledge <strong>you should have to care for your baby ferret</strong>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>There are a lot of ferret games out there that you can play with your pet.</strong> You just need to find the one that is right for you and your ferret. A lot of the games out there are played at parties and other social occasions, and you’ll probably want to use one of those. But, if you don’t have a party to go to or you’re not interested in using one of those, here are some of the <a href="https://ferretvoice.com/ferret-games/">best games for your ferret</a> that you can use at home.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0248/4522/1987/files/Fun_Ferret_Games.jpg?v=1586407963" alt="Fun Ferret Games"></p><p><strong>Cat and mouse are a very common ferret game.</strong> First, you get the ferret started, and then you move around it, so it’s on the ground and hide. Your goal is to see where the ferret goes as you move around it. If it’s on the ground, it needs to come up to it and eat it. If it’s hiding under furniture or in the corner, it needs to find your mouse so that you can get rid of it.</p><p>Get Your Cell Phone Out is a lot like a cat and mouse except that instead of a mouse you are seeking your cell phone. You have to move around it so that it can’t just stand still and see you. The more times that you move, the better the chances are that the ferret will get up and eat your phone!</p><p><strong>Hunt or Be Hunted is a great game that you can do at home.</strong> It’s easy to set up. Just put a pad of paper and some paper towels in your ferret cage and then start the hunt. When you catch it just pick it up and put it back in the cage.</p><p><strong>Wall Jumping is another excellent game that you can use with your ferret.</strong> Just set up the wall and then have the ferret stand behind it and jump on it. If he can successfully make it to the other side, he’s in!</p><p>Place them on a bed of coins or pebbles and then have them jump over them. You can get the jump on the coins by placing them in a bowl of water. Wait until they jump and then clean the coins in the bowl so that they can’t be eaten! This game is great because the ferret can play it alone or with friends.</p><p><strong>Food Chains</strong> is a game that you can do at home. All you need is some metal plates, a little bit of sugar and a toy such as a ball. And get ready for some fun: the ferret is the owner, and the toys are the owners.</p><p>Use the plates to make the ferret jump into the ball to get it through the rings of “food” until he makes it through all the rings. Then let the ferret come to you so that you can keep track of where it went. You can even record it to watch later and see how well he did.</p><p>This game of ours is a favorite that we’ve both played at home with our ferrets. Basically, you get two sticks that you can use to make an obstacle course. We just pile the sticks together and let our ferrets try to jump over them. They can touch the stick as they pass, and it’s easier for them to jump over it.</p><p>Here’s a simple game that you can play with your ferret: make a hoop or a jump rope with the ferret. It’s OK if the ferret falls off, but at least you’ll get the exercise that you need. Then, put a little bit of sugar on the end of the hoop and let the ferret jump on it.</p><p><em><strong>Here’s a fun game that you can play:</strong></em> make a maze of pieces of cardboard that all have a long straight line on the top and bottom. Then each time the ferret jumps over one of the cardboard pieces, give it a little sugar! Then put another piece in the middle of the line, and the ferret jumps on it. And make sure to keep the line straight so that the ferret doesn’t fall.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Many new ferret owners will quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the differences between owning a ferret and owning other, more common, pets.</strong> <a href="https://ferretvoice.com/ferret-care-tips/">There are many aspects about basic ferret care and more involved health issues you should be familiar with.</a> Here are some of the most important parts of basic ferret care to help you become a great ferret owner! It’s also a great refresher for seasoned ferret owners.</p><h2 id="Finding-an-Experienced-Ferret-Veterinarian"><a href="#Finding-an-Experienced-Ferret-Veterinarian" class="headerlink" title="Finding an Experienced Ferret Veterinarian"></a>Finding an Experienced Ferret Veterinarian</h2><p>There are many veterinarians who will tell you that they treat ferrets, but a veterinarian who specializes in ferrets is best. It’s very important to locate a qualified, experienced ferret veterinarian as soon as possible after you bring your ferret home. However, <a href="https://ferretvoice.com/buy-ferrets-online/">it’s best to see if there’s one in your area before purchasing your ferret</a>. The veterinarian you find should be able to do a routine checkup and administer vaccines. If your regular veterinarian cannot treat more serious health problems or perform surgeries, ask him or her to recommend a veterinarian who can.</p><p>You will also want to locate the nearest 24 hour emergency animal hospital that will treat ferrets. Ferrets often fall ill in the evening, late at night, or on weekends when your veterinarian’s office is not open. Given how quickly ferrets can be affected by illness, you will want to get them to a veterinarian as quickly as possible, and it often cannot wait until your regular veterinarian is available.</p><h2 id="Routine-Checkups"><a href="#Routine-Checkups" class="headerlink" title="Routine Checkups"></a>Routine Checkups</h2><p>Make an appointment with an experienced ferret veterinarian for a routine checkup at least once a year. This is for the purpose of general preventive care, but also allows your veterinarian to familiarize himself with your ferret so he can more easily identify when your ferret is unhealthy. Annual exams should include weighing your pet; checking eyes, ears, and teeth; listening to the heart and lungs, and examining the ferret for any internal or external lumps or abnormalities. You should also discuss any questions regarding behavior, diet, parasite control, or other issues with your veterinarian at this time.</p><p>As the ferret gets older (generally over 3 years of age), you will also want your veterinarian to run annual blood work, including a blood glucose test, to detect any health problems that can’t be diagnosed by a physical examination alone. Ferrets over the age of three are at a higher risk of developing insulinoma and other diseases that you want your veterinarian to diagnose as early as possible.</p><h2 id="Annual-Vaccinations"><a href="#Annual-Vaccinations" class="headerlink" title="Annual Vaccinations"></a>Annual Vaccinations</h2><p>Ferrets need to be vaccinated yearly against rabies and canine distemper. While there has never been a recorded case of a ferret contracting rabies, the rabies vaccination serves as protection for your ferret in case she bites someone. Imrab-3 is the rabies vaccine of choice for ferrets. Get your ferret vaccinated at three months and then yearly thereafter. By law, all rabies vaccinations must be administered by a veterinarian.</p><p>Canine distemper is an airborne disease and is much more common in ferrets than rabies. It is deadly to unvaccinated ferrets. Even if your ferret never leaves the house or never has contact with other animals, you can still bring the virus into the house on your clothes and shoes, so it is important to stay up to date on your ferret’s distemper vaccination. The only USDA approved vaccination is Purevax, though many veterinarians also recommend the use of Galaxy-D. Have your ferret vaccinated at 8, 11, and 14 weeks, and then yearly thereafter.</p><p>Talk to your veterinarian about giving the rabies and distemper vaccinations at least two weeks apart. Many ferret owners believe that giving the vaccines at the same time may increase the risk of a reaction. Whether or not that is true, it means that it will be more difficult to determine which vaccine was the cause of the reaction. Some ferrets are allergic to components of distemper or rabies vaccines. Allergic ferrets may show a reaction known as anaphylaxis. Within minutes of being vaccinated, the ferret begins vomiting, and may also have diarrhea. Some go limp and may lose consciousness. Ferrets that have this reaction once will not necessarily have another when given a different vaccine, but it is likely that they will react to the same type of vaccine again. It is wise to remain at the veterinary office for 30 - 45 minutes after an injection is given to a ferret that once reacted to a vaccine. There is a treatment that works rapidly to reverse the reaction, if given soon after the first signs are noticed. The longer the reaction has been going on, the more difficult it is to reverse it.</p><p>An allergic ferret may be treated with oral antihistamine an hour or more before he is vaccinated, to prevent an adverse reaction occurring. Your veterinarian can dispense the correct product and dose when a vaccination is scheduled.</p><p>When you are at your veterinarian, you should also have your ferret tested for heartworm and placed on a heartworm preventive. Although heartworm in ferrets isn’t as common as it is in dogs and cats, it is more deadly because ferrets are a lot smaller in size.</p><h2 id="Prevent-Hairballs"><a href="#Prevent-Hairballs" class="headerlink" title="Prevent Hairballs"></a>Prevent Hairballs</h2><p>It is normal for ferrets to shed heavily twice a year - once during the fall before they get their winter coats and once during the spring as they shed their winter coats. During these times, your ferret will be at risk of developing a hairball. As she grooms herself, she will ingest the loose hair. Ferrets cannot throw up hairballs as cats can, so the hair remains in her stomach and intestines, forming blockages. Blockages in ferrets are a life threatening condition, and must be treated aggressively and immediately, often with surgery.</p><p>The best way to prevent hairball blockages is to give your ferret a laxative or hairball remedy, such as Marshall Ferret Lax once a week throughout the year and more frequently during shedding seasons. If you have multiple ferrets, it is possible that only one may be shedding heavily. However, you still want to give the hairball remedy to all of them, as cage mates will groom each other and ingest each other’s hair.</p><h2 id="Cleaning-Ears"><a href="#Cleaning-Ears" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning Ears"></a>Cleaning Ears</h2><p>Clean your ferret’s ears at least once every two weeks or more often if your ferret builds up earwax quickly. A solution like Professional Pet Products Ferret Ear Cleaner works well to keep ferret ears clean. Excessive ferret earwax causes strong odors and puts your ferret at a higher risk of ear infections. Normal earwax is brown or reddish brown in color. Black, crumbly earwax can be a sign your ferret has ear mites, and you should make a veterinary appointment if you suspect your ferret has ear mites.</p><h2 id="Clipping-Nails"><a href="#Clipping-Nails" class="headerlink" title="Clipping Nails"></a>Clipping Nails</h2><p>Trim your ferret’s nails with ferret-specific trimmers at least once every two weeks or more often as needed. When a ferret’s nails grow too long, they start to curl under her feet, making it painful for her to walk. Additionally, long nails can get caught on bedding, rugs or other items, causing them to splinter or even rip off as your ferret struggles to free herself. Some ferrets have even broken their toes in their attempts to free snagged nails.</p><h2 id="Environmental-Conditions"><a href="#Environmental-Conditions" class="headerlink" title="Environmental Conditions"></a>Environmental Conditions</h2><p>Temperatures above 75°F can be dangerous to ferrets, and temperatures above 90°F can be fatal. Ferrets cannot pant to cool themselves, so once they are overheated, heatstroke develops rapidly. Ferrets are most comfortable at 65-68°F, and during the summer you will need to provide your ferret with a cool, air conditioned environment.</p><p><strong>Here are a few tips to keep your ferret cool:</strong></p><ul><li>Never leave your ferret in a car.</li><li>Keep your ferret’s cage out of direct sunlight.</li><li>Always provide cool water for your ferret to drink.</li><li>Freeze water in soda bottles, wrap them in towels, and put them on top of or next to your ferret’s cage.</li><li>Move your ferret to the coolest room in your house.</li></ul><p>One common misconception is that a fan will help your ferret to stay cool. In fact, this can make an intolerable heat level even worse, as you are blowing warm air at your ferret. If you are going to use a fan, put a bowl of cool water or ice behind or in front of it, but do not rely on this method alone to cool your ferret properly. Use a fan to circulate the air, but do not allow it to blow directly on your ferret.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The importance of ferret health and grooming needs shouldn’t be underestimated or taken lightly. When you follow a regular grooming and care routine, you will help reduce stress on your ferret and help your ferret become as healthy and comfortable as he can possibly be.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Ferret-Fact-1-A-ferret’s-average-lifespan-is-6-–-8-years"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-1-A-ferret’s-average-lifespan-is-6-–-8-years" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #1: A ferret’s average lifespan is 6 – 8 years."></a>Ferret Fact #1: A ferret’s average lifespan is 6 – 8 years.</h3><p>This means you will need to plan to care for your ferret for a minimum of 6 years. Some ferrets live to be 9 or even 12. When you bring a fuzzy into your home, it depends on you and bonds with you. There are many ferrets who are surrendered or abandon who simply die of a broken heart (better known as shelter shock) when their human leaves them or decides that he or she doesn’t want ferrets anymore. If you know that in 3 years you are going to college, or you aren’t sure if your new landlord will allow ferrets, then a fuzzy isn’t the pet for you. Use the time until you will be able to provide a ferret with a forever home to brush up on your ferret knowledge and become a ferret expert! You’ll be a better ferret parent for it in the long run.</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-2-Ferrets-can-be-very-expensive-pets"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-2-Ferrets-can-be-very-expensive-pets" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #2: Ferrets can be very expensive pets."></a>Ferret Fact #2: Ferrets can be very expensive pets.</h3><p>Ferrets may be small, but the cost of caring for them is definitely not! Keep in mind that in addition to the cost of food, litter, toys and bedding, you will also have vet bills to pay. They require annual vaccinations (rabies &amp; distemper), and if you only have to go to the vet once a year with your vet, you’re a lucky ferret owner! Ferrets can have a lot of health problems, including medical emergencies that require immediate attention. One of the most common life threatening problems with young ferrets is blockages, which can easily happen when they eat things they shouldn’t (bedding, rubber, pieces of human food such as nuts or granola ). Blockages are dangerous and usually very expensive to remove. Ferrets are also very susceptible to various cancers, and it’s rare when a ferret makes it to the end of its life without getting Adrenal disease, Insulinoma or Lymphoma. Many people start a savings account when they purchase ferrets to help with those emergencies. If you know that you have money set away in case of emergency, then necessary medical care won’t be delayed. If you don’t think you can afford to put a little money away each week or each month, then a ferret probably isn’t for you.</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-3-Ferrets-are-NOT-rodents"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-3-Ferrets-are-NOT-rodents" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #3: Ferrets are NOT rodents."></a>Ferret Fact #3: Ferrets are NOT rodents.</h3><p>Ferrets aren’t rodents; they are in the family Mustelidae, along with weasels, mink, badgers, wolverines, skunks, sea otters and polecats. Their scientific name is Mustela putorius furo, or just Mustela furo. Since they aren’t in the rodent family, their needs are very different from that of rodents. For example, ferrets do NOT have teeth that continue to grow, so please don’t give them wood to chew on! They don’t need it! Ferrets are carnivores, and their diets should be full of meat and other animal proteins with very few carbs. They don’t eat hay, fruit, veggies or other treats that are great for our rodent friends. They cannot be left in cages like hamsters, and in fact require at least 2 hours a day of human interaction out of the cage, though 4 or more is preferable. They are NOT a good pet for a young child, as their care requires a responsibility that young children just do not have. If you do want to get a ferret for your child, be prepared to pick up the slack, as proper daily care is crucial to a ferret’s health and socialization.</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-4-Ferrets-are-carnivores"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-4-Ferrets-are-carnivores" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #4: Ferrets are carnivores."></a>Ferret Fact #4: Ferrets are carnivores.</h3><p>As mentioned previously, ferrets are carnivores, but what does this mean? It means that they have canine teeth like cats and dogs. It means that most of their nutritional needs are met by animal proteins, therefore their diet and most of their treats should be meat based. Food should have no less than 34% protein and 20% fat, and it should contain taurine (which is why dog food doesn’t provide the proper nutrition). Fiber intake should be kept to a minimum, as ferrets don’t have a cecum, the body cavity where fiber is digested. Non-meat treats should only be given in moderation, and this includes nonacidic fruits, cereals (low salt and low sugar only), and eggs (cooked only, no raw). Never ever give your fuzzy alcohol, sugary drinks and foods, drinks with caffeine, nuts, or chocolate. Many ferrets are lactose intolerant, so dairy products can cause diarrhea.</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-5-Ferrets-have-a-musky-odor-but-keeping-their-surroundings-clean-easily-keeps-that-odor-under-control"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-5-Ferrets-have-a-musky-odor-but-keeping-their-surroundings-clean-easily-keeps-that-odor-under-control" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #5: Ferrets have a musky odor, but keeping their surroundings clean easily keeps that odor under control."></a>Ferret Fact #5: Ferrets have a musky odor, but keeping their surroundings clean easily keeps that odor under control.</h3><p>Like other carnivores, ferrets are born with scent glands, but most ferrets are descented before being sent to pet stores for sale. Descented ferrets do still have a musky odor to them, but it’s very faint, and not at all comparable to their skunk cousins in the wild! Contrary to what you might believe, bathing your fuzzy is not the key to keeping that odor at a minimum. Over-bathing your ferret will actually dry its skin out, which will cause an overproduction of oil, which in turn will cause a stronger smell. Bathing should be done only 3 or 4 times a year. The key to keeping ferret odors mild is to keep the ferret’s environment clean. Litter boxes should be scooped daily, and cleaned thoroughly with a solution that neutralizes odors once a week. Bedding should be washed once a week or more. Odor neutralizing laundry detergents can be very helpful in eliminating tough smells. Ferrets will rub themselves up against the bars, depositing oils, so the cage itself should be cleaned and wiped down very well about once a month. Clean their ears as needed, usually about once or twice every couple weeks. When ear wax builds up, it can give a ferret’s head a decidedly unpleasant odor!</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-6-Ferretproofing-is-vital-to-your-ferret’s-safety-when-it’s-out-of-its-cage"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-6-Ferretproofing-is-vital-to-your-ferret’s-safety-when-it’s-out-of-its-cage" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #6: Ferretproofing is vital to your ferret’s safety when it’s out of its cage."></a>Ferret Fact #6: Ferretproofing is vital to your ferret’s safety when it’s out of its cage.</h3><p>Since fuzzies need at least a few hours out of their cages each day to play, you will need to have a ferret friendly space in your house. If you are going to let them run around in your living space, it’s imperative that you make sure the room is as “ferretproofed” as possible. Ferretproofing is an ongoing process, but there are a few steps you can take to start.<br>If your ferret’s head will fit through a space, it’s very likely that the rest of your ferret will fit there as well. Get down on your hands and knees and look for small spaces that your ferret could get into.<br>Make sure all cabinets and drawers are firmly closed, and put some kind of latch on easy to open drawers and doors.<br>Make sure your ferret has no way to climb up onto tables or high shelves<br>Make sure there are no items the ferret could ingest that could cause a blockage (soft rubbery things like remote buttons, cables, etc)<br>Cut off access to rooms, such as the kitchen, that contain lots of dangerous appliances.<br>Don’t put recliners in rooms where your ferrets go (they could be crushed inside the chair).<br>Needless to say, this isn’t even close to a full list of what should be ferretproofed, but it’s a good start. Your ferretproofing skills will develop over time anyway as you see what naughty places your fuzzy finds most fascinating!</p><h3 id="Ferret-Fact-7-Ferrets-are-very-social-creatures"><a href="#Ferret-Fact-7-Ferrets-are-very-social-creatures" class="headerlink" title="Ferret Fact #7: Ferrets are very social creatures."></a>Ferret Fact #7: Ferrets are very social creatures.</h3><p>Ferrets need companionship, whether it’s your companionship or that of another ferret. Left alone in their cages without human or ferret interaction, ferrets will become depressed, destructive, and sometimes even ill. It’s important to allow your fuzzy ample time out of its cage every day, 4 hours at the minimum. You should play with your ferret at least 2 hours every day, more so if it is an only child! This will also help to socialize it. Ferrets that bite and aren’t friendly as they grow older are fuzzies that haven’t been handled enough. If you have a space in your house that is ferret friendly, let your ferret run around as much as possible. Ferrets that get a lot of time out of their cages to run, play and interact are healthier and happier!</p><p>As you can see, ferrets are very unique little creatures! If you keep all of these important facts in mind when you get your fuzzy, you’ll be a great ferret parent!</p><p>Dooks to all!</p><p>Official WEBSITE:<a href="https://ferretvoice.com/">Ferretvoice.com</a></p>]]></content>
